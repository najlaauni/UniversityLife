## 🧠 Reflection
In this course, I learned about the importance of ethics, honesty and integrity in both personal and professional life. I discovered how corruption affects society, the economy and organizational trust. Through case studies and discussions, I understood Malaysia’s initiatives and laws in preventing corruption. In my point of view, incorporating case studies and role-playing scenarios like the videos we made in the previous could make the learning about integrity more impactful. This course taught me that success is not only about knowledge or skills, but also requires persistence in keeping up with the strong moral values and ethical principles in all one's actions.
