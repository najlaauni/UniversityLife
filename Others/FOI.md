### 🧠 Reflection  
Over the four days at PICC, I was exposed to innovation in a way that felt fun and interactive. It was exciting to explore every booth, interact with exhibitors, and see how different fields, from AI and sustainability to culture and creative design could come together to shape the future.

One of the memorable experiences for me was taking part in hands-on workshops where I decorated mini cupcakes and learned how to package popcorn! Besides that, the talks and forums were especially impactful. Hearing experts discuss digital transformation, aerospace innovation and Malaysia’s future direction gave me a fresh perspective on how fast the world is changing. Seeing the Prime Minister, Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim, in person and listening to his message about youth innovation made the experience even more memorable and I felt motivating and encouraging after these talks.

Another part that made FOI special was the journey itself. We traveled from UTM to Putrajaya by bus every early morning. It was so fun to take a break from campus life, explore a new place and experience something different. In my opinion, stepping outside the usual university routine made the event feel like an adventure, not just an academic activity.

All in all, FOI 2025 left a strong impression on me. It reminded me that learning is not only about lectures and assignments, it’s also about exploring, interacting with people and experiencing new environments. It allowed me to explore ideas with my coursemates, connect with other students and appreciate how innovation drives positive change. This event strengthened my motivation as a Data Engineering student to use technology creatively to transform ideas into reality.
