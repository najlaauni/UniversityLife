# 🔧 Assignment 1
This repository contains my personal record of Assignment 1 (Section 02) for my coursework. The task for this assignment was to construct a flow chart based on 2 sets that were given by the lecturer.

Date: 29 October 2025 until 3 November 2025

## 📘 Task Description

This assignment must be done in pairs which means a group consisting of 2 members. We got set 2 which needs to construct a flow chart that develops a Loan Calculator to estimate a monthly installment and help to plan finances. From set 2, we have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided output of the set that we got 
- Construct a flow chart that has the same output as a set that we got
- Apply : <br>
  a) Branching/selection (if..else)<br>
  b) Loop/repetition (repeat..until/do..while)<br>
  c) User-defined function flow chart. Besides the main function flow chart, at least one more other function flow chart. Use appropriate arguments for the function.
- Save the file using the required naming format  
- Submit the flowchart through the eLearning platform

## 🪞 Reflection
The first assignment was to create a flowchart for a Loan Calculator which made me realize the application of logical structures in problem-solving and program planning. I understood how to decompose a practical problem into unambiguous and methodical steps by switching the supplied set output to a flowchart.

This assignment strengthened my understanding of branching, looping, and user-defined functions. Applying selection statements such as if–else helped me manage different conditions, while loops allowed repeated calculations until certain requirements were met. Designing an additional function flowchart besides the main flowchart improved my understanding of modular design and how functions help organize a program more efficiently.

Working in pairs encouraged collaboration and discussion, especially when deciding the most logical flow for calculations and conditions. By means of this process, my confidence in visualizing algorithms and confirming the flowchart to generate accurate and consistent outputs was increased. In general, this task not only improved my logical thinking ability but also gave me a practical experience in algorithm design which will be beneficial for future programming-related subjects.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement
For future assignments, providing more sample flowcharts or reference outputs would help students better understand the expected level of complexity and structure. This would be especially helpful for beginners who are still adapting to flowchart conventions.

Additionally, allowing a brief consultation or feedback session before submission could help students verify their logic and reduce errors in branching or looping. This would improve learning outcomes and confidence in the final submission.

Lastly, introducing or recommending digital flowchart tools could improve clarity and presentation, making complex logic easier to understand and review, especially when submitted as a soft copy.
