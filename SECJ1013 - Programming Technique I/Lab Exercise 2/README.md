# 🔧 Lab Exercise 2
This repository contains my personal record of Lab Exercise 2 (Section 02) for my coursework. The task for this lab exercise was to write a complete C++ program based on 4 sets that were given by the lecturer.

Time: 12:00pm - 12.50pm  
Venue: MPK10, N28

## 📘 Task Description

I chose set 1 which needs to write a complete C++ program that reads an integer number and then calculates the sum of its digits. After that, identify whether the sum of digits for the integer is a multiple of 3, 4, and/or 5. Also, I should use operator divide (/) and modulus (%) and also post-test loop to answer this question. From set 1, I have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided output of the set I chose 
- Write a complete C++ program that has the same output as a set that I chose
- Save the file using the required naming format  
- Submit the complete C++ program through the eLearning platform

## 🪞 Reflection
In Lab Exercise 2, I got to use my algorithmic thinking skills when I implemented a whole C++ program based on the problem that was given. The program, which took an integer, found the sum of its digits, and then tested if the sum were a multiple of 3, 4, or 5, helped me a lot with the concepts of loops, conditionals and even arithmetic operators like division (/) and modulo (%).

Using a post-test loop made me realize the difference between the check after and before the execution; thus making sure that the digit processing will take place at least once. This move was also a sign of improving my capacity to convert a flowchart or computer logic into real C++ code thereby strengthening the bond between program design and coding.

The physical lab experience of working under strict timing conditions for the lab increased my focus, time management, and debugging skills. This lab exercise, in general, was a boost to my confidence in writing structured C++ programs and also in solving numerical problems efficiently.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement
For future lab exercises, providing sample input and output cases before the session begins would help students better understand the expected program behavior.

Additionally, allowing a brief feedback or code review session after submission could help students identify logical or syntax errors and improve their coding techniques.

Lastly, offering practice questions before the lab session would help students prepare better and reduce time pressure during the actual lab exercise.
