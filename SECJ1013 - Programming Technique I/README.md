## 🧠 Reflection
This was my first step into real programming and I learned how to use C++ to solve problems logically. I understood the importance of algorithms, flow control (loops and conditions) and modular programming using functions. Debugging and writing code taught me patience and attention to detail. In my opinion, I believe that assigning mini-projects such as a basic calculator and a small game like Tic-Tac-Toe would help us improve our teamwork and coding skills. I feel accomplished and satisfied when a program I wrote run successfully. By the end of the course, I could write programs to process data, perform calculations and solve real-world problems. It also strengthened my logical thinking and problem-solving mindset, which are essential for future software development.
