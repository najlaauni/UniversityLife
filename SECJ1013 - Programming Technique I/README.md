## 🧠 Reflection
In this course, this was my first step into real programming and I learned how to use C++ programming language to solve problems logically. I understood the importance of algorithms, flow control (loops and conditions) and modular programming using functions. Debugging and writing code taught me patience and attention to detail. From my point of view, I believe that assigning mini-projects such as a basic calculator and a small game like Tic-Tac-Toe would help us improve our teamwork and coding skills. I feel accomplished and satisfied when a program I wrote run successfully. By the end of the course, I could write programs to process data, perform calculations and solve real-world problems. Furthermore, it boosted my logical reasoning and problem solving capabilities that are the cornerstones of any future software development project.
