# 🔧 Assignment 3
This repository contains my personal record of Assignment 3 (Section 02) for my coursework. The task for this assignment was to write a complete C++ program based on 2 sets that were given by the lecturer.

Date: 30 December 2025 until 12 January 2026

## 📘 Task Description

This assignment must be done in pairs which means a group consisting of 2 members. We got set 2 which needs to write a complete C++ program to calculate the total and average number of students' intake, enrolment, and output in public universities for 2015. Then, find the highest and lowest number of students' intake, enrolment, and output. Finally, find the range of the number of students' intake, enrolment, and output. From set 2, we have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided output of the set that we got 
- Construct a complete C++ program that has the same output as a set that we got
- Apply : <br>
  a) function. <br>
  b) input file.<br>
  c) output file.
- Save the file using the required naming format  
- Submit the complete C++ program through the eLearning platform

## 🪞 Reflection
For this assignment, I had to write an entire C++ program that would take care of the functions and analysis of the data of student intakes and enrollments as well as the output of public universities in Malaysia. This helped me to create a stronger link between problem analysis, algorithm design, and C++ programming.

Besides this, through this assignment I learned a lot more about file management with input and output files, especially how to make sure that the input file has been opened successfully before the processing of the data. The introduction of user-defined functions like getInput, calTotal, getLowest, and getHighest made me appreciate the main benefit of modular programming, which is that each function has a specific role. This led to better organization, readability, and ease of debugging for the program.

Moreover, dealing with arrays let me do data analysis operations, like calculating totals, averages, highest, lowest, and range values. This hones my logical thinking and reinforces my understanding of array manipulation and function parameter passing. Overall, this assignment has made me more confident in the C++ program development process such as creating flexible programs that will give out meaningful reports on the basis of real-world data.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement
In upcoming tasks, the provision of input and output formats in a clearer way would be really useful and this would minimize misunderstandings and also guarantee that the programs give the same results.

Furthermore, a code review or feedback session could be introduced before the final submission to help students recognize logic or syntax mistakes and thus, student's coding practices could be improved.

Moreover, the use of version control systems, e.g., GitHub, for submitting or monitoring progress could be allowed or even promoted as it would enable students to control their code more professionally and learn through practice, a skill that is in demand in the industry.
