# 🔧 Assignment 3
This repository contains my personal record of Assignment 3 (Section 02) for my coursework. The task for this assignment was to write a complete C++ program based on 2 sets that were given by the lecturer.

Date: 30 December 2025 until 12 January 2026

## 📘 Task Description

This assignment must be done in pairs which means a group consisting of 2 members. We got set 2 which needs to write a complete C++ program to calculate the total and average number of students' intake, enrolment, and output in public universities for 2015. Then, find the highest and lowest number of students' intake, enrolment, and output. Finally, find the range of the number of students' intake, enrolment, and output. From set 2, we have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided output of the set that we got 
- Construct a complete C++ program that has the same output as a set that we got
- Apply : <br>
  a) function. <br>
  b) input file.<br>
  c) output file.
- Save the file using the required naming format  
- Submit the complete C++ program through the eLearning platform

## 🪞 Reflection
For this assignment, I had to write an entire C++ program that would take care of the functions and analysis of the data of student intakes and enrollments as well as the output of public universities in Malaysia. This helped me to create a stronger link between problem analysis, algorithm design, and C++ programming.

Besides this, through this assignment I learned a lot more about file management with input and output files, especially how to make sure that the input file has been opened successfully before the processing of the data. The introduction of user-defined functions like getInput, calTotal, getLowest, and getHighest made me appreciate the main benefit of modular programming, which is that each function has a specific role. This led to better organization, readability, and ease of debugging for the program.

Moreover, dealing with arrays let me do data analysis operations, like calculating totals, averages, highest, lowest, and range values. This hones my logical thinking and reinforces my understanding of array manipulation and function parameter passing. Overall, this assignment has made me more confident in the C++ program development process such as creating flexible programs that will give out meaningful reports on the basis of real-world data.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement
In case of further duties giving a more distinct example of the input and a format for output expected would be very much appreciated. This would eliminate misunderstandings and make it certain that learners during file reading and writing are using the correct format.

Moreover a small code review or feedback session conducted prior to the final submission could assist students in early detection of logical or formatting mistakes and thus the overall coding quality would be improved.

To sum up, making the use of version control systems like GitHub for assignment submissions mandatory or at least permissive would be advantageous. The students would not only be able to monitor their changes, organize their code better, but also get acquainted with one of the industry practices that are considered as professional software development skills that are immediately useful in the field.
