# 🔧 Lab Exercise 4
This repository contains my personal record of Lab Exercise 4 (Section 02) for my coursework. The task for this lab exercise was to write a complete C++ program based on the following question.

Date: 9 January 2026  
Time: 11:00pm - 11.50pm  
Venue: MPK6, N28

## 📘 Task Description

From the question, I need to write a complete C++ program that converts temperature values from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula C = 5/9 × (F − 32). The program must read a list of Fahrenheit values from a text file, store them in an array, compute the corresponding Celsius values, and classify each temperature as High (H), Medium (M), or Low (L) based on given conditions. Also, I have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided output of the question 
- Construct a complete C++ program that has the same output as a question
- Save the file using the required naming format  
- Submit the a complete C++ program and input data file through the eLearning platform

## 🪞 Reflection
This lab exercise was a great way to see programming applied to practical everyday scenarios such as temperature monitoring and processing of data that could be used for health or environmental analysis. Reading a file and writing a structured output to another file was a demonstration of how C++ programs can handle large datasets effectively rather than just making the user provide input from the keyboard.

I also deepened my knowledge of arrays, function, and parameter passing. Separating the functions for reading files, processing values, averaging, assessing temperatures, and generating output made the program easier to understand and less likely to be defective. Generally it was pretty hard at first, particularly double-checking that the output format was proper, but the entire procedure has developed my reasoning and problem-solving ability.

Ultimately, this lab gave me more faith in my capacity to create organized C++ programs that incorporate file handling, mathematical calculations, and if statements. It also made me realize that being precise and meticulous is a must since even the tiniest of errors in formulas or formatting can give rise to wrong results.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement
For future lab exercises, providing a clearer explanation of the grading criteria (H, M, L) with more worked examples before the lab session would help students avoid logical errors during implementation.

Additionally, it would also be beneficial to include a short demonstration on file input/output handling in C++ prior to the lab, as this is a common difficulty for beginners.

Lastly, offering a brief post-lab review session to discuss common mistakes and optimal solutions could further improve students’ understanding and coding confidence.
