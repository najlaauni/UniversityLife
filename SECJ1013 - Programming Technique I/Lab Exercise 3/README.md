# 🔧 Lab Exercise 3
This repository contains my personal record of Lab Exercise 3 (Section 02) for my coursework. The task for this lab exercise was to write a complete C++ program based on the following question.

Date: 19 December 2025  
Time: 11:00pm - 11.50pm  
Venue: MPK6, N28

## 📘 Task Description

From the question, I need to write a complete C++ program that helps the Ministry of Health (MOH) to determine the status of a zone by calculating the number of active cases for COVID 19. Also, I have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided output of the question 
- Construct a complete C++ program that has the same output as a question
- Save the file using the required naming format  
- Submit the a complete C++ program through the eLearning platform

## 🪞 Reflection
The third lab exercise had the requirement that I code a complete program in C++ to tell the COVID-19 zone status by the number of active cases. It was a very helpful exercise for me to see that programming usefulness goes beyond mere computer scientists and is the case especially with the public health decisions by government authorities.

The lab was very intensive but at the end of it, I was very much more skilled to use logical comparisons and conditions to do accurate zone classifications of calculated values. 'Boring' but needed steps of translating the problem statement and expected output into a C++ program worked as a drill for my ability to analyse the requirements and implement them in the code correctly.

Even though the time for the lab was quite limited, it made me solve problems more efficiently and develop my debugging skills. The primary reason behind changing my debugging technique was to ensure that the program was error free and gave the correct output. However, the lab task made me more confident about writing C++ structured programs and it also revealed that accuracy and clarity in programming are the main tools for solving real-life problems.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement
For future lab exercises, providing clearer explanation of the classification criteria such as threshold values for each zone in advance would help students avoid confusion and logical errors.

Additionally, allowing a short post-lab discussion or feedback session could help students review common mistakes and improve their understanding of decision-making logic in programming.

Lastly, offering additional practice problems with similar real-world scenarios would help students build confidence and apply concepts more effectively during lab assessments.
