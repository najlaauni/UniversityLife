# 🔧 Lab 1 — Combinational Logic
📆**Date:** 17 November 2025  
🕑**Time:** 2pm - 4pm  
📍**Location:** N28 - 328 01/02  

## 📌 Overview
This lab introduces the basics of combinational logic circuits. It focusing on hands-on wiring, breadboarding and verifying logic gate behaviors through real hardware testing. The purpose of this lab was to build simple logic circuits and test them using switches and LEDs to verify their truth tables.  

We used several IC logic gates such as:

- 7408 — AND Gate
- 7404 — NOT Gate (Inverter)
- 7432 — OR Gate

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn proper breadboard wiring techniques  
- Understand how to use input switches and output LEDs  
- Test and verify the behavior of basic logic gates  
- Build circuits and compare the real output with theoretical truth tables

## 📝 Reflection

This lab was my first hands-on experience with digital logic and it was fun and interesting! It helped me understand how theoretical logic gates behave in real hardware. Before this, I felt logic gates were abstract because everything was done on paper. In my opinion, it feels more interactive by using breadboards, switches and LEDs.

One of the challenges I faced was to ensure the wires were connect correctly and to make sure the circuit was clean and organized to avoid mistakes and errors. Besides that, I also learned the importance of checking the IC orientation and verifying logic outputs using the mode switch and LEDs.

All in all, this lab helped me connect theory with physical implementation. Now, I feel more confident to handle logic gate circuits and interpret the truth tables from real measurements instead of only theoretical assumptions.
