## 🧰 Tools Used

Deeds Simulator (d-DcS): A graphical schematic editor used for building, animating, and analyzing digital networks. It allows for both interactive "animation" of inputs and timing-mode simulations to observe signal sequences over time.

## 📌 Overview
The lab session presented the fundamental principles of combinational logic circuit design, simplification, and optimization using Boolean algebra and K-maps. Besides, it was mainly about the practical aspect of using the Deeds Simulator to construct digital networks, generate timing diagrams, and verify logic behaviors through software-based simulation and universal gate implementation.

## 🎯 Objectives
The objectives of this lab session are to:
- expose student with producing digital logic circuit, generating truth table and Timing Diagram with Deeds Simulator.
- expose student with a complete cycle process of a combinatorial circuit design and simulate with Deeds Simulator.

## 🧪 Laboratory Work

Part 1 — Circuit Analysis
Students are given a specific logic circuit and must derive its initial Boolean expressions. These expressions are simplified into Sum of Product (SOP) and Product of Sum (POS) forms using De Morgan’s Theorem and other logic rules. Students then verify their manual work by simulating the circuit in Deeds to generate truth tables and timing waveforms.

Part 2 — Combinational Circuit Design 
This section involves a practical design problem: creating a logic circuit to control an LRT coach door (OPEN and ALARM signals) based on the coach's status and its arrival at specific stations (S1, S2, or S3).
Design Process:
- Defining input/output relations and constructing a truth table.
- Using Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps) to find optimized SOP equations.
- Implementing the design in Deeds Simulator.
- Converting the initial circuit into a design using only NAND gates, demonstrating their status as "Universal Gates".

## 📝 Reflection

As a first-year student, the Digital Logic Lab session was a fun and eye-opening experience for me. It was my first hands-on exposure to digital logic using real hardware such as breadboards, switches, and LEDs. Before this lab, logic gates felt very abstract because everything was learned on paper. Being able to physically build the circuits helped me clearly understand how theoretical logic gates behave in real hardware.

During the lab session, I learned how to properly connect wires on the breadboard and ensure the circuit was neat and organised to avoid errors. I also realised the importance of checking the IC orientation carefully and verifying logic outputs using the mode switch and LEDs. These steps required patience and attention to detail, but they helped me better understand how small mistakes can affect the entire circuit.

Besides gaining technical knowledge, this lab helped me connect theory with physical implementation, making the learning process more interactive and meaningful. I now feel more confident in handling logic gate circuits and interpreting truth tables based on real measurements rather than purely theoretical assumptions. Overall, I am grateful for this hands-on experience as it strengthened my understanding of digital logic and motivated me to keep improving my practical skills in the field of electronics.
