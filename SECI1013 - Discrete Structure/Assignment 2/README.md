## 📘 Task Description

This assignment must be done in a group consisting of 3 members which has been arranged by our lecturer. We need to solve all the questions by writing them neatly and readily on the plain A4 paper. However, because the due date is on our midterm break, we need to send it through eLearning as a soft copy. From this assignment, we have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided questions 
- Answer all 7 questions :
  - list down the element, domain and range of R. Also, draw the diagraph of the relation and determine whether the relation is assymetric or not.
  - list all possible member of R and justify the answer. 
  - construct the matrix of relation, list in-degrees and out-degrees of all vertices, and determine whether the relation is a partial order relation or not.
  - determine whether the function is one–one, onto, or bijective.
  - find the inverse and composition function.
  - write the recurrence relation and use it to find the value of 𝑃ହ.
  - write a recursive algorithm to calculate the nᵗʰ term of the sequence and trace the recursive steps to compute 𝑠ସ .
- Write all the names of members of the group on the front page   
- Submit the assignment as a soft copy through eLearning.
