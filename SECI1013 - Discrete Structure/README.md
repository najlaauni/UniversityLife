## 🧠 Reflection
In this course, I gained mathematical knowledge essential for computer science, such as set theory, relations, functions and graph theory. I learned how logic, proofs and combinatorics are applied to algorithms and data structures. This course trained me to think critically and logically, which improved my ability to approach programming and system design systematically. From my point of view, including more real-life examples and programming-based exercises could make abstract concepts more relatable and easier to understand. Now, I understand how mathematical reasoning supports almost every part of computing, from database design to software engineering, which now I apply not only in math-related problems but also in coding and system desgin.
