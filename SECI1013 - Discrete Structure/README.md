## 🧠 Reflection
In this course, I gained mathematical knowledge essential for computer science, such as set theory, relations, functions and graph theory. I learned how logic, proofs and combinatorics are applied to algorithms and data structures. This course trained me to think critically and logically, which improved my ability to approach programming and system design systematically. From my point of view, providing more day-to-day instances and activities based on programming would facilitate the comprehension of abstract ideas. Nevertheless, I have come to the conclusion that mathematical reasoning is the backbone of almost all computing applications, be it database design or software engineering, which I now use not just in mathematics but also in coding and system design.
