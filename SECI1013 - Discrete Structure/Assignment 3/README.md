## 📘 Task Description

This assignment must be done in a group consisting of 3 members which has been arranged by our lecturer. We need to solve all the questions by writing them neatly and readily on the plain A4 paper. From this assignment, we have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided questions.
- Answer all 6 questions :
  - show that at least 2 certificates share the same folder and the minimum number of people.
  - probability (question 2 to 6). 
- Write all the names of members of the group on the front page
- Submit the assignment as a hard copy through the lecturer

## 🪞 Reflection
Working on Assignment 3 about Counting & Discrete Probability Theory was an exercise in basic theories and principles applied in mathematical problem-solving. I got better acquainted with simple counting rules and probability-making calculations, which were very elaborate and required careful reasoning and attention to detail. The first question, which was about proving how many people at least need to be so that two certificates share the same folder, was very enlightening and could clearly be seen as applying the Pigeonhole Principle and thus making an abstract idea very easy to grasp.

The probability questions (Questions 2 to 6) put me in a position where I had to apply different probability rules correctly, such as spotting sample spaces, counting the favorable outcomes, and letting all assumptions be known. Writing full solutions neatly on plain A4 paper also challenged me to communicate the mathematical reasoning in a systematic and logical way. I discovered that the clarity in explanation is just as much as the correctness of the final answer.

A group of three that worked together was a good mix for the whole process as it was very encouraging since there was more talk and brainstorming involved. We were able to find mistakes early and learn from each other by sharing different points of view through practical work done by dividing questions and checking each other’s solutions. To sum up, this assignment was a great help in the development of my logical thinking, a reinforcement of my basics in probability, and an increase in my assurance of handling discrete math problems that will be a prerequisite for further studies in mathematics and computer science.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement
In future assignments, it would really be beneficial if more sample questions or worked examples were included, mostly for the topics such as recurrence relations and recursive algorithms, since they need a careful step-by-step understanding.

In addition, putting up detailed marking rubrics could be a good way to show the students how the marks are distributed and where the requirement of explanation for each question lies. This would encourage more structured and precise answers.

Lastly, since this assignment was submitted as a soft copy, allowing the use of typed mathematical solutions or digital tools such as equation editors could improve readability and reduce ambiguity in handwritten work, especially for complex diagrams, matrices, and recursive traces.
