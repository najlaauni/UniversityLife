## 📘 Task Description

This assignment must be done in a group consisting of 3 members which has been arranged by our lecturer. We need to solve all the questions by writing them neatly and readily on the plain A4 paper. However, because the due date is on our midterm break, we need to send it through eLearning as a soft copy. From this assignment, we have been required to : <br>
- View and understand the provided questions.
- Answer all 7 questions :
  - list down the element, domain and range of R. Also, draw the diagraph of the relation and determine whether the relation is assymetric or not.
  - list all possible member of R and justify the answer. 
  - construct the matrix of relation, list in-degrees and out-degrees of all vertices, and determine whether the relation is a partial order relation or not.
  - determine whether the function is one–one, onto, or bijective.
  - find the inverse and composition function.
  - write the recurrence relation and use it to find the value of 𝑃5.
  - write a recursive algorithm to calculate the nᵗʰ term of the sequence and trace the recursive steps to compute 𝑠4 .
- Write all the names of members of the group on the front page.
- Submit the assignment as a soft copy through eLearning.

## 🪞 Reflection
The Relations, Functions, and Recurrence Assignment 2 was one of the best ways to grasp how mathematical ideas could be pictured in different styles like sets, matrices, digraphs, and algorithms. It was through this task that I found out how relations could be studied by finding the domain and range of the relations, depicting them with the help of digraphs, and establishing properties like asymmetry and partial order.

Among the tasks in this assignment which were most difficult but also the most significant was the interaction of functions and recurrence relations. Identifying a function as one-one, onto, or bijective took a lot of reasoning and fiding inverse and composition of functions made me much faster and more accurate person in handling function rules. Writing a recurrence relation and tracing a recursive algorithm step by step developed my logic and gave me a clear picture of how sequences are defined and computed.

The group work for this assignment during the midterm break not only taught us but also required great time management and communication among the members. Taking on different parts and talking about various solution methods helped us to confirm our answers and prevent errors. In summary, this project enlarged my abilities in problem-solving and also gave my confidence a shot in the arm when it came to the area of relations, functions, and recursive processes which are very important for future math and computer science classes.

## 💡 Suggestions for Improvement
In future assignments, it would really be beneficial if more sample questions or worked examples were included, mostly for the topics such as recurrence relations and recursive algorithms, since they need a careful step-by-step understanding.

In addition, putting up detailed marking rubrics could be a good way to show the students how the marks are distributed and where the requirement of explanation for each question lies. This would encourage more structured and precise answers.

Lastly, since this assignment was submitted as a soft copy, allowing the use of typed mathematical solutions or digital tools such as equation editors could improve readability and reduce ambiguity in handwritten work, especially for complex diagrams, matrices, and recursive traces.
