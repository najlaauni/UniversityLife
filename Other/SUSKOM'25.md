## 📌 Summary About SUSKOM’25 (Sukan Sains Komputer)

SUSKOM’25 is a yearly sports occasion performed by and for Computer Science students of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), held from 19–21 December 2025. Through various competitive sports activities, the event aimed at promoting unity, sportsmanship, and collaboration among computing students from different faculties and batches. In addition to competition, SUSKOM’25 became a breeding ground for leadership, teamwork, and respect to be built in the diverse academic community.
Being part of the SUSKOM’25 team, I was able to help with the event running by being a Line Judge during the badminton tournament. This job needed a lot of care, fairness, and accountability to ensure that the matches were held in a smooth and professional manner. The event brought out three main values:
- Sportsmanship & Integrity
  Promoting the honesty and fairness of students through rules and competition.
- Collaboration & Teamwork
Making a strong cooperation between the organizers, officials, and participants of different faculties and backgrounds.
•	Community Engagement
Strong ties beyond the classroom through shared experiences, cooperation, and mutual support were formed.
To sum up, SUSKOM’25 was not just a sports competition, but a community-driven event that showcased unity and professionalism among the Computer Science students and reflected their values.

## 📝 Reflection

Attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 as a first-year student was truly eye-opening for me. It gave me a clear understanding of how important quantum technology will be for the future of ASEAN, especially in areas like cybersecurity, communication, and advanced computing. I was amazed to see that all ASEAN Member States, together with international partners, are now investing seriously in building a shared quantum ecosystem. The summit also highlighted an important message for my own development: succeeding in the technology field requires more than just academic achievement. It also demands curiosity, continuous learning, hands-on experience, and the willingness to explore new, emerging fields like quantum science.

Throughout this sessions, I learned how quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum sensing are becoming foundational technologies for the next generation of digital infrastructure. The demonstrations of quantum-secure networks helped me understand how critical security and data protection will be in the future. Meanwhile, the research collaborations signed between universities and industry partners showed me that quantum development requires strong teamwork across countries, disciplines, and expertise. I also realised that quantum science is deeply connected to mathematics, physics, and data engineering fields I am already interested in, which made the summit even more meaningful to me.

After attending the summit, my interest in quantum technology grew much stronger because it is a field with tremendous potential and long-term impact. I believe this area will continue to expand rapidly in ASEAN, and being involved early could open many exciting opportunities for research, postgraduate studies, and future careers. The summit inspired me to strengthen my mathematical and technical foundation so that I can one day contribute to the development of quantum technologies in the region. Overall, I am grateful to UTM and all the organisers for giving students like me the chance to be part of such a significant event. This experience truly motivated me to keep improving myself and to explore how I can play a meaningful role in ASEAN’s quantum future!

## 🔧 Suggestions for Improving Programme
- Include hands-on quantum demos or beginner-friendly workshops so students can better understand how quantum computing and communication work in practice. <br>
- Provide clear career roadmaps showing the skills, courses, and pathways needed to enter the quantum technology field in ASEAN. <br>
- Share follow-up materials such as slides, recorded talks, or beginner guides to help students continue learning after the summit. <br>
