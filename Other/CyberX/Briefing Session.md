## 📖 Summary About The Programme

In Briefing Session of CyberX Club, this club has introduced The Capture The Flag (CTF) Workshop that serves as an important introductory event designed to expose students to the fundamentals of cybersecurity through practical, challenge-based learning. As one of the key entry points into the cybersecurity field, CTF competitions help participants develop technical skills, analytical thinking, and problem-solving abilities in a hands-on environment. The workshop brings together students with varying backgrounds to learn how real-world cyberattacks work and how to defend against them, making it a meaningful first step for beginners.

The workshop highlighted several core pillars of foundational cybersecurity learning:<br>
- Introduction to CTF Competitions<br>
  Participants gained an understanding of what CTF competitions are, the different categories involved, how flags are captured, and the fundamental strategies beginners should adopt when approaching challenges.<br>
- Basic Web Exploitation<br>
  Students were introduced to how web applications function and learned about common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and directory traversal. This session also emphasised early secure coding practices to build awareness of common security flaws.<br>
- Basic Reverse Engineering<br>
  The workshop covered the essentials of binary and program analysis, helping participants understand how executables behave. It also provided an overview of commonly used tools and taught students to recognise behavioural patterns instead of relying solely on source code.<br>

Collectively, these sessions equipped students with foundational skills and exposure to cybersecurity concepts, representing an essential step toward building future talents in ethical hacking, digital defence, and cyber resilience

## 🧠 Reflection
Today, I attended the CyberX briefing session and we were introduced to the fundamentals of cybersecurity and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Before this session, I have no idea about the concepts like CTF challenges, web exploitation and reverse engineering. However, after listening to the explanations and examples, I realized that cybersecurity is not just about programming knowledge, it’s also about logical thinking, problem solving and being passion when facing different challenges.  

The introduction to CTF showed me how cybersecurity skills can be applied in a hands-on and competitive environment. Besides that, the basics of web exploitation helped me understand how real vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited. From my point of view, the reverse engineering sharing session was the most interesting part, because it showed how programs behave at a deeper level beyond source code.  

Overall, this session strengthened my motivation to continue learning cybersecurity step by step. Now, I feel more confident to explore beginner-friendly CTFs and participate in upcoming workshops. I’m excited for the journey ahead and looking forward to build my skills through practice and real-world challenges.
