## 🧠 Reflection
Today, I attended the CyberX briefing session and we were introduced to the fundamentals of cybersecurity and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. Before this session, I have no idea about the concepts like CTF challenges, web exploitation and reverse engineering. However, after listening to the explanations and examples, I realized that cybersecurity is not just about programming knowledge, it’s also about logical thinking, problem solving and being passion when facing different challenges.  

The introduction to CTF showed me how cybersecurity skills can be applied in a hands-on and competitive environment. Besides that, the basics of web exploitation helped me understand how real vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited. From my point of view, the reverse engineering sharing session was the most interesting part, because it showed how programs behave at a deeper level beyond source code.  

Overall, this session strengthened my motivation to continue learning cybersecurity step by step. Now, I feel more confident to explore beginner-friendly CTFs and participate in upcoming workshops. I’m excited for the journey ahead and looking forward to build my skills through practice and real-world challenges.
