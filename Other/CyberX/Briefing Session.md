## 📖 Summary About The Programme

In Briefing Session of CyberX Club, this club has introduced The Capture The Flag (CTF) Workshop that serves as an important introductory event designed to expose students to the fundamentals of cybersecurity through practical, challenge-based learning. As one of the key entry points into the cybersecurity field, CTF competitions help participants develop technical skills, analytical thinking, and problem-solving abilities in a hands-on environment. The workshop brings together students with varying backgrounds to learn how real-world cyberattacks work and how to defend against them, making it a meaningful first step for beginners.

The workshop highlighted several core pillars of foundational cybersecurity learning:<br>
- Introduction to CTF Competitions<br>
  Participants gained an understanding of what CTF competitions are, the different categories involved, how flags are captured, and the fundamental strategies beginners should adopt when approaching challenges.<br>
- Basic Web Exploitation<br>
  Students were introduced to how web applications function and learned about common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and directory traversal. This session also emphasised early secure coding practices to build awareness of common security flaws.<br>
- Basic Reverse Engineering<br>
  The workshop covered the essentials of binary and program analysis, helping participants understand how executables behave. It also provided an overview of commonly used tools and taught students to recognise behavioural patterns instead of relying solely on source code.<br>

Collectively, these sessions equipped students with foundational skills and exposure to cybersecurity concepts, representing an essential step toward building future talents in ethical hacking, digital defence, and cyber resilience

## 🧠 Reflection
Attending the CyberX briefing session as a first-year student was truly eye-opening for me. It gave me a clear introduction to the world of cybersecurity and helped me understand how important skills like logical thinking, problem-solving, and curiosity are in this field. Before this session, I was barely familiar with terms such as CTF challenges, web exploitation, and reverse engineering. However, after the session, I recognised that cybersecurity is not only about programming but also creative thinking, tenacity, and the ability to see problems in various ways.

Throughout the session, I learned how Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions provide a hands-on and competitive environment to apply cybersecurity skills in real time. The introduction to web exploitation helped me understand how vulnerabilities are discovered and used to break insecure systems, making me more aware of the importance of secure coding. For me, the reverse engineering segment was the most fascinating part. It showed how programs behave behind the scenes and how analysing binaries can reveal hidden logic and weaknesses. This deeper view of software made me appreciate how broad and interconnected cybersecurity really is.

After attending this programme, my interest in cybersecurity has grown much stronger because I now see the vast potential and exciting challenges the field offers. I believe that starting early will give me more opportunities to develop the skills needed for future competitions, internships, and cybersecurity roles. This session motivated me to take my learning step by step—exploring beginner-friendly CTFs, joining workshops, and building practical experience. Overall, I am grateful for this opportunity, as it truly inspired me to keep improving myself and to work towards becoming more confident and capable in the cybersecurity field.
