## 📌 Summary About the Talk

This industry talk, titled "Project Management & System Development", was delivered by Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim. The session emphasized that system development is the core language of a future career in Computer Science and highlighted the transition toward an AI-driven industry. The presentation focused on three key pillars of building a professional foundation:
- **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** <br>
  Standardizes the whole process of application software development including definition, design, testing, and implementation instead of just coding.<br>
- **Project Management (PM) Methodologies** <br>
  Controls complexity and ensures team synergy through structured approaches like Waterfall or Agile to keep projects on track and within budget.<br>
- **Agentic Coding & System Architecture** <br>
  Transform the function of a developer from "Coder" to "System Architect" that deals with invisible AI agents to develop, test, and run sophisticated systems.<br>

These core competencies are essential for avoiding the "FYP Trap" and achieving a success formula for future-ready graduates.

## 📝 Reflection
Attending the industry talk by Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim as a first-year student was genuinely eye-opening for me.  I was able to have a very distinct notion that System Development is not merely a subject matter of the book, but the main language of my future profession. The lecture transmitted an important message regarding professional growth that was honestly in line with my thoughts: today's success is in a "New Success Formula" composed of 40% Coding & AI and 60% System and Project Management skills, thus confirming my urgency to acquire a practical architectural experience right away.

At the time of SDLC presentation, I came to the conclusion that the successful software projects basically consist of the five main areas: planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance. The PM discussion on the other hand, showed how much of an impact methods like Agile and Waterfall have on the management of chaos and the communication between teams that are located in different places around the globe. In addition, the agentic coding section affirmed that the AI agents are taking over the coding field, and I need to change my role from "Coder" to "System Architect" who controls the AI that does the system's building. Through those parts of the presentations, I not only learned but also started to compare and value how far apart and yet so close all the tech jobs are from Data Engineering to Network Security.

After the industry talk, my interest in mastering these core skills grew even stronger because the presentation exposed the "FYP Trap" warning me not to wait until my final year to understand complete system building. I believe this field will continue to grow as we enter the age of autonomous developers, and mastering these frameworks will give me a valuable pathway for my future career. Currently, my goal is to gain complete control over these technical and managerial layers, thus making it possible for me to create significant value globally. In general, I want to thank Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim for allowing me to see the computer science journey from a new perspective. The lecture was a big encouragement for me to pursue my self-improvement continually and to realize that secure and reliable systems are established on the principles of secure design architecture.
