## 📌 Summary About the Talk

The industry talk by PPG provided useful insights into how business intelligence (BI) and information systems are applied in real industrial settings. The speaker began by introducing PPG as a global chemical company involved in producing paints, coatings, and silica products for industries such as tyres and rubber manufacturing.

She then explained the role of Power BI as a reporting and analytics platform used to transform raw data into meaningful information for decision-making. To make the concept easier to understand, the speaker used a dessert-making analogy to describe how data flows from different sources to end users. In this analogy, ingredients represented data (such as sales and customer data), suppliers represented data sources like SQL Server and SAP, logistics represented networks such as VPN and the Internet, storage symbolized databases and data warehouses, kitchen appliances represented servers and cloud computing, recipes symbolized software such as Power BI, chefs represented BI developers, and customers represented business users.

In addition, the speaker introduced the three main components of Power BI: Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service, and Power BI Mobile. She also briefly explained system architecture and how VPN settings can be adjusted to ensure that only authorized users can access specific reports and information.

## 📝 Reflection
As a student, I found this talk very informative because it helped me visualize how theoretical concepts that we learn in class are applied in real industrial environments. The dessert-making analogy was especially helpful, as it simplified complex topics such as data pipelines, storage systems, and reporting tools into something easy to understand.

The talk also made me realize that information systems are not only about programming, but about integrating data, networks, hardware, and software to support business operations. Seeing how Power BI is used in a large company like PPG increased my appreciation of the importance of data analytics and business intelligence in modern organizations.

Furthermore, the message shared by the speaker and reinforced by Dr. Aryati reminded me that continuous learning is essential in the technology field. Even when certain subjects feel difficult or less interesting, mastering them is important for long-term growth. This talk motivated me to improve not only my technical knowledge, especially in data and analytics, but also my communication and problem-solving skills so that I can be better prepared for future industry challenges. Overall, this session strengthened my determination to make full use of the learning opportunities provided at UTM and to continuously upskill myself for both academic success and career readiness.
