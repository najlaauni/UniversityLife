## 📌 Summary About the Talk

The visit to Johor Corporation (JCORP) was very interesting and it showed how a big company uses the latest technology in real business situations. The meeting was headed by Mr. Budiman Bujang, who presented how JCORP uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and data analytics to help not only with daily operations but also with making strategic decisions.

JCorp has several initiatives in place that he described such as ServiceNow monitoring systems, Microsoft Copilot, and a Command Centre that is backed by real-time data and sophisticated analytics. These technologies enable efficient monitoring, faster responses, and more informed managerial decisions.

In addition, we were introduced to JCORP’s TRIA Initiative (AI, Automation, and Analytics), which represents the organisation’s vision of becoming an AI-first enterprise by embedding intelligent systems across its operational structure. Beyond technology, the working environment at JCORP was also impressive, featuring a calm, garden-themed office layout that promotes employee comfort and productivity.

## 📝 Reflection
As a student, I found this talk very informative because it helped me visualize how theoretical concepts that we learn in class are applied in real industrial environments. The dessert-making analogy was especially helpful, as it simplified complex topics such as data pipelines, storage systems, and reporting tools into something easy to understand.

The talk also made me realize that information systems are not only about programming, but about integrating data, networks, hardware, and software to support business operations. Seeing how Power BI is used in a large company like PPG increased my appreciation of the importance of data analytics and business intelligence in modern organizations.

Furthermore, the message shared by the speaker and reinforced by Dr. Aryati reminded me that continuous learning is essential in the technology field. Even when certain subjects feel difficult or less interesting, mastering them is important for long-term growth. This talk motivated me to improve not only my technical knowledge, especially in data and analytics, but also my communication and problem-solving skills so that I can be better prepared for future industry challenges. Overall, this session strengthened my determination to make full use of the learning opportunities provided at UTM and to continuously upskill myself for both academic success and career readiness.
