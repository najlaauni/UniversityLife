## 📌 Summary About the Talk

The visit to Johor Corporation (JCORP) was very interesting and it showed how a big company uses the latest technology in real business situations. The meeting was headed by Mr. Budiman Bujang, who presented how JCORP uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and data analytics to help not only with daily operations but also with making strategic decisions.

JCorp has several initiatives in place that he described such as ServiceNow monitoring systems, Microsoft Copilot, and a Command Centre that is backed by real-time data and sophisticated analytics. These technologies enable efficient monitoring, faster responses, and more informed managerial decisions.

In addition, we were introduced to JCORP’s TRIA Initiative (AI, Automation, and Analytics), which represents the organisation’s vision of becoming an AI-first enterprise by embedding intelligent systems across its operational structure. Beyond technology, the working environment at JCORP was also impressive, featuring a calm, garden-themed office layout that promotes employee comfort and productivity.

## 📝 Reflection
As a first-year student, attending this industry visit was a truly eye-opening experience for me. It enlightened me that computer science is not merely a matter of coding, but rather a question of technological deployment in a smart way so that the problem of the organization is solved.

One of the statements that affected me a lot was the one of Mr. Yusri Mohamed, who stressed that in the present world, career readiness is not determined only by academic performance but also by the individual's awareness and comprehension of the technology trends. This very thought made me realize that learning must be continuous, particularly in the AI and data analytics areas. The trip increased my persisted aspiration to learn more about the existing technology and to be equally with the future job market. The fact that I witnessed the implementation of AI and analytics in a business operation gave a stronger point to my choice of a technology-related career.

On the whole, this trip was very enjoyable and very uplifting to me. I cannot help but thank the JCORP group for the very friendly manner in which they treated me, for the information they shared with me, and for their amiable attitude towards me. In addition, I am very grateful to our teacher, Dr. Aryati Bakri, who opened this door for me, and I wish to apply my learning for the good of the industry in the future.
