## 📌 Summary About the Talk

The industry talk by PPG provided useful insights into how business intelligence (BI) and information systems are applied in real industrial settings. The speaker started off by PPG introduction as a worldwide chemical corporation dealing with the manufacture of paints, coatings, and silica products for a variety of markets including tyres and rubber industry.

Then, the speaker revealed the function of Power BI as a platform for reporting and analytics that is employed to convert raw data into significant data for the purpose of decision-making. In order to facilitate the understanding of the concept, the speaker resorted to a dessert making analogy to illustrate the way data travels from different sources to the end users. According to this analogy, the ingredients stood for data (sales and customer data, for instance), suppliers were the data sources like SQL Server and SAP, logistics represented networks like VPN and the Internet, storage was symbolizing databases and data warehouses, kitchen tools were the servers and cloud computing, recipes were the software such as Power BI, chefs were the BI developers, and customers were the business users.

Moreover, the speaker presented Power BI's three main components: Power BI Desktop, Power BI Service, and Power BI Mobile. She also, in passing, talked about the system architecture and the way VPN settings can be altered to make sure that only the people who have the permission will be able to reach the specific reports and information.

## 📝 Reflection
As a first-year student, attending this industry visit was a truly eye-opening experience for me. I found this talk very informative because it helped me visualize how theoretical concepts that we learn in class are applied in real industrial environments. The dessert-making analogy was especially helpful, as it simplified complex topics such as data pipelines, storage systems, and reporting tools into something easy to understand.

The talk also made me realize that information systems are not only about programming, but about integrating data, networks, hardware, and software to support business operations. Seeing how Power BI is used in a large company like PPG increased my appreciation of the importance of data analytics and business intelligence in modern organizations.

Furthermore, the message shared by the speaker and reinforced by Dr. Aryati reminded me that continuous learning is essential in the technology field. Even when certain subjects feel difficult or less interesting, mastering them is important for long-term growth. This talk motivated me to improve not only my technical knowledge, especially in data and analytics, but also my communication and problem-solving skills so that I can be better prepared for future industry challenges. Overall, this session strengthened my determination to make full use of the learning opportunities provided at UTM and to continuously upskill myself for both academic success and career readiness.
