## 🌟Reflection
In this course, I explored the foundations of IT and its applications in organizations such as data management and system design. I learned about hardware, software, networking and how information systems support decision-making. I hope there are more hands-on lab sessions like the earlier PC Assembly Lab Practical because I found it was a great way for me to learn practical skills and PC components. Besides that, I would love to have more industry talks like the previous PPG Industry Talk, as I found it helped me gain a clearer understanding of the job roles, skill requirements and future job opportunities that are not covered in textbooks. This course gave me a clearer picture of how IT professionals contribute to different industries and inspired me to continue learning about technology’s impact on society.
