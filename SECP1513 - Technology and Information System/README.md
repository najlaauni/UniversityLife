## 🌟 Reflection
In this course, I learnt about the foundations of IT and its applications in organizations, including data management and system design. I learnt about hardware, software, networking and how information systems support decision-making. I hope there will be more practical lab sessions because the previous PC Assembly Lab Practical was a great way for me and my classmates to learn useful skills and understand PC components. Besides that, I like to see more industry talks, similar to the most recent PPG Industry Talk, which helped me and my classmates understand job roles, required skills, and future career opportunities that are not covered in textbooks. Overall, this course improved my understanding of how IT professionals contribute to various industries and inspires me to focus not only on skill-building but also on real-world application so can apply them meaningfully.
