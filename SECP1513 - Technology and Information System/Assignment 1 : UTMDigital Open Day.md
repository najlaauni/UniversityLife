## 🧠 Reflection
As a first-year student, the visit to UTMDigital Open Day was a truly meaningful experience for me. During the visit, I had the chance to look around a lot of interesting booths featuring innovative projects and creative ideas. It was such a valuable experience to learn, connect, and get inspired by passionate individuals and organizations. Not only that, I was also able to communicate directly with UTMDigital staff by interviewing them and learning from their real-world experiences, which made the visit even more valuable.<br>

For my part in the project, I took on the role of designer and researcher. I was responsible for deciding how the vlog would look, taking some photos and videos, and making sure everything captured represented our experience well. After filming, I organised all the materials and sent them to my group member, Nurain Nabilah, to compile it. We also decided how to make the video look attractive and fun, but still follow the rules. This made the editing process smoother and kept everything neat and organised. I also actively participated in the Q&A sessions, which allowed me to engage with the staff directly and deepen my understanding of their work. Plus, I was delighted to receive a gift, which made the experience even more memorable.<br>

Besides gaining new knowledge through these tasks, I realised how much I enjoy planning, designing, and presenting ideas visually. The event also helped strengthen my communication skills, boosted my confidence, and improved my teamwork with my group members. I felt inspired by the professionalism of the UTMDigital staff and motivated to develop my own skills further. Also, I am grateful to the UTMDigital staff and our lecturer, Dr. Aryati bt Bakri, for giving us the opportunity to understand more about campus IT operations. This visit was an incredibly enlightening and memorable experience, and I can’t wait to put what I’ve learnt into practice as I continue my journey in the tech field!<br>

## 🔧 Improvement Suggestions
