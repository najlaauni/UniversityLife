## ✨ Summary
The Student Enhancement SECP (Data Engineering) Programme 2025 was organized to strengthen students’ professional development and readiness for the workplace. The program focused on several key aspects, such as UTM Graduate Attributes, CV writing, experience sharing from our 4th-year seniors and fun group-based activities in the evening which is a mentor-mentee programme guided by our 2nd and 3rd-year seniors to enhance our teamwork and leadership skills.  

The speakers are:<br>
- UTM Graduate Attributes – Mr. Baharudin Mastari (Senior Deputy Registrar, Faculty of Computing, UTM JB) <br>
- CV Writing – Ms. Noor Hazwani Ramli (Founder of GetMe Hired)<br>
- Learning Beyond the Classroom – Sharing from our 4th-year seniors<br>

Some advice that have truly resonated with me:<br>
💭 “Learning is not a race, but it’s about connecting and growing.” – Neo Zheng Weng<br>
💭 “Master one stack first before moving to others. Go deep into one area until you truly understand it, rather than trying to learn everything at once.” – Yong Wern Jie<br>
💭 “Don’t just watch tutorials, start actively practice what you learn.” – Camily Tang Jia Lei <br>
💭 “Be honest. It’s okay not to know everything. Interviewers value honesty and willingness to learn more than pretending to know.” – Ng Shu Yu<br>

They all shared valuable insights on professional growth, employability, and experiences.

## 🧠 Reflection
As a first-year student, joining the Student Enhancement SECP (Data Engineering) Programme 2025 was a very meaningful and inspiring experience for me. I truly enjoyed listening to the speakers and learning from the seniors. Throughout the day, I gained so many valuable insights that made me reflect on my future journey in Data Engineering.

The first session was about UTM Graduate Attributes by Mr. Baharudin Mastari. His reminder that “knowledge must be high, manners also must be high” really made me realise that being a good graduate is not only about academic skills, but also about character, attitude, and how we carry ourselves. During the CV Writing session with Ms. Noor Hazwani Ramli, I got to know the significance of constructing experience through activities such as volunteering, hackathons, and side projects, which eventually would lead to a stronger CV. Additionally, we had a sharing session with our 4th-year seniors, and I felt their advice was extremely relatable, like university life is not just a race for grades but also a journey of growth, connection, and exploration. In the evening, we had a mentor-mentee activity with our 2nd and 3rd-year seniors that were open to sharing their experiences, from study tips to personal struggles. I learned a lot from them, and their encouragement made me feel more confident about my academic journey.

Overall, I feel very grateful for the new knowledge, motivation, and meaningful connections with seniors and friends. This experience reminded me to keep growing, stay curious, and grab the chances that will make me better, and I am excited to join more programmes like this in the future!

## 🔧 Suggestions for Improving SECP Programme
As for me, I think this programme is very perfect. It allows us, first-year students, to discuss in smaller groups with seniors about their experiences, from study tips to personal struggles. Not only that, all the speakers also help us see real-world job variety and find what fits. They also share resources and learning roadmaps for us, first-year students, to know how to start building skills. Maybe the programme needs to allow students to give anonymous feedback right after the event, so organizers know what worked and what can be improved for future sessions.
