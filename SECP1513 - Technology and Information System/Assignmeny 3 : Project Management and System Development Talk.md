## 📌 Summary About the Talk

This industry talk, titled "Project Management & System Development," was delivered by Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim. The session emphasized that system development is the core language of a future career in Computer Science and highlighted the transition toward an AI-driven industry. The presentation focused on three key pillars of building a professional foundation:
- **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** <br>
  Standardizes the whole process of application software development including definition, design, testing, and implementation instead of just coding.<br>
- Project Management (PM) Methodologies <br>
  Controls complexity and ensures team synergy through structured approaches like Waterfall or Agile to keep projects on track and within budget.<br>
- Agentic Coding & System Architecture <br>
  Transform the function of a developer from "Coder" to "System Architect" that deals with invisible AI agents to develop, test, and run sophisticated systems.<br>

These core competencies are essential for avoiding the "FYP Trap" and achieving a success formula for future-ready graduates.

## 📝 Reflection
Attending the PPG industry presentation as a first-year student was genuinely eye-opening for me. It helped me clearly understand the important role PPG plays as one of the few companies in the world that supply paints and coatings for many well-known products from everyday devices and screens to the drink cans we use daily. Not only that, the talk also delivered a critical message on professional development that truly resonated with me: that said career advantage lies not just in academic excellence (CGPA), but equally in demonstrating practical application through project experience, technical skills, and essential soft skills, reinforce my need to build real-world experience immediately.

During the presentation on Global Infrastructure, I learned how cloud architecture, platform engineering, LAN/WAN, servers, security, and databases form the backbone of PPG’s operations. Meanwhile, the SAP session highlighted the importance that enterprise resource planning plays in controlling processes of big scale, supply chains, and communication among worldwide teams. Furthermore, the Data Analytics segment confirmed that the field requires not only mastery of diverse technical skills like programming, ELT, data visualization, and database design  but also the most important soft skills of strong logical thinking and problem-solving. These three sections made me appreciate how broad and interconnected technology roles really are.

After the industry talk, my interest in the PPG industry grew even stronger because the company has a solid technology ecosystem, a mature workflow, and well-defined skill requirements. I believe this field will continue to grow, and joining PPG would give me a valuable pathway for my future career. My motivation is now to master these technical layers to ensure I can deliver meaningful and high-impact business value on a global scale. Overall, I am grateful to the PPG staff and our lecturer, Dr. Aryati bt Bakri, for giving us the opportunity to understand more about the PPG industry. The industry talk really inspired me to keep improving myself and hope that one day I will have the opportunity to join PPG to gain hands-on experience and contribute my skills to the team!
